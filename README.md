# Simple page

##Description
A one page example of using additional plugins to reach a sertain quality in a task.

##Installation
For everything to work properly, you should install 2 things before running the page:
- After pulling the project go to this url: https://owlcarousel2.github.io/OwlCarousel2/
- Click the button download and save the folder in the folder of the project.
- This is a plugin for the carousel, without it it won't work properly.
- The second thing is installing jQuery, but I trust you don't need instructions about it. :)
After these two things are ready you can open the html page.
